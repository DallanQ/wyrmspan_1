OVERVIEW During a game of Wyrmspan, you will build a sanctuary for dragons. Your sanctuary begins with 3 excavated spaces—the leftmost space in your Crimson Cavern, your Golden Grotto, and your Amethyst Abyss. Throughout the game, you will build out these 3 caves from left to right, first excavating each empty space, then playing dragons into these excavated spaces.

Each turn, you will take 1 of 5 actions: (1) excavate a space; (2) entice a dragon to come live in an excavated space; (3) explore your Crimson Cavern; (4) explore your Golden Grotto; or (5) explore your Amethyst Abyss.

## Terminology

PLAYER MAT Your personal player mat that holds cave cards, dragons, and eggs.

CAVE CARD Square cards that are added to your player mat through the excavate action. Each cave card that you play covers 1 of the 9 empty spaces on your player mat and turns that space into an excavated space.

DRAGON Rectangular cards that may be placed onto any excavated space, including the 3 spaces that are excavated at the beginning of the game.

RESOURCES Meat tokens, gold tokens, crystal tokens, and milk tokens. Coins and eggs are not considered "resources."

CAVE A row of spaces on your player mat. Each player mat has 3 caves: the Crimson Cavern, the Golden Grotto, and the Amethyst Abyss.

DISCARD/PAY Remove the cards, coins, eggs, or resources from your player area, hand, or nests, placing them in the public supply. Cards are always discarded face up.

GAMEPLAY Wyrmspan takes place over 4 rounds. Each round, players take several turns in clockwise order, beginning with the player who has the start player marker.

Players continue taking turns until they decide to pass; this typically occurs when a player has used all of their coins or they do not have any dragons in their hand that they wish to (or can afford to) play. Once a player has passed, they may not take any additional turns during that round, but they may still gain benefits during other players' turns.

Other players who have not passed continue to take turns until they spend all of their coins or otherwise choose to pass. Once all players have passed, the round ends.

Note that when players pass, they may carry over coins, resources, cave cards, dragons, and nested eggs into the next round.

TIP: It is strongly recommended that players use most (or all) of their coins prior to passing. Players gain an income of 6 coins at the beginning of each round (and in rare circumstances may gain 1 additional coin after they pass for a round). At the end of each player's turn, that player must discard down to 9 coins, 9 cards, and 9 resource tokens.

IMPORTANT: You may never place items on or remove items from other players' player mats; all abilities that you activate allow you to interact only with the general supply, the central boards (Dragon Guild board, card display board, etc.), and your own player mat.

The winner of Wyrmspan is the player with the most victory points (VP). These are earned in a variety of ways, including the VP value of played dragons, eggs, tucked cards, public objectives, and the Dragon Guild (see page 15).

ON YOUR TURN Select one action on your player mat (excavate, entice, or explore), move your adventurer there, pay the cost of that action (place the coin/eggs on the action), and then perform the action. If the public supply of eggs or coins runs low, players may return excess tokens from their mats to the supply; however, players must track the number of times they have explored each cave during the round.

EXCAVATE PLAY A CAVE CARD INTO 1 OF YOUR CAVES.

1

Select the left-most empty space in 1 of the 3 caves to excavate. You must excavate each cave from left to right.

- The first space in each cave is already excavated, so over the course of the game you may excavate the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th spaces in each cave.

- Any cave card can be placed in any cave; the colors of the cave cards are purely for aesthetics.

Pay the base cost of 1 coin, placing it on the entice action on your player mat. Then pay the additional cost printed at the upper-left of the selected dragon (return these to the general supply).

IF YOU ALREADY KNOW WINGSPAN …please pay close attention to these key differences in Wyrmspan: • Actions are performed by spending coins and often eggs (not action cubes) • Explore your caves from left to right to activate abilities (not right to left) • There are two nest icons on your cave mat even before you play a dragon • Start the game with your choice of 4 cards (from 3 dragons and 3 caves) and a choice of any 3 resources • Gain 6 coins and 1 egg at the beginning of each round (four total rounds) • A 2-for-1 resource exchange can be used at any time (not just when playing a card)

- You must excavate a cave space before enticing (playing) a dragon to that space; you begin the game with 3 excavated spaces • Card abilities are optional. If an ability gives an opponent a benefit, they may gain it even if you decline to do so. • Discard down to 9 cards, 9 coins, and 9 resource tokens at the end of each of your turns • The end-round goal scoring is friendly. For example, if two people tie for first, they both gain full VP for first place. The next player takes second place.

## Dragon Abilities All Dragons Have An Ability Or Benefit Printed On Them. These Come In  Types:

When you play a dragon with a "when played" benefit, you may gain the indicated benefit immediately. Unless you have a special ability, you will only activate this ability once. These benefits are not mandatory, though it is usually in your best interest to gain them. If you play a dragon that gives opponents a benefit, the other players must be allowed to collect their benefit, even if you decline yours.

Whenever your adventurer walks onto a dragon card with an "if activated" ability, you may activate that ability. If you activate an "if activated" ability that gives opponents a benefit, the other players must be allowed to collect that benefit, even if you decline to do so.

IMPORTANT: "If activated" abilities do not activate the turn that you play the dragon.

"Once per round" abilities provide a benefit at the end of every round. See additional details in the Round End/Upkeep section. If you activate a "once per round" ability that gives opponents a benefit, the other players must be allowed to collect that benefit, even if you decline to do so.

"End game" abilities provide Victory Points (VP) at the end of the game for meeting certain conditions.

## Example Dragon Card

To play this dragon, pay 1 meat and 1 gold. (If you used the entice action to play this dragon, you also must pay 1 coin.)

Caves where this dragon can live are indicated on the left side of the dragon card. This dragon can live in the Crimson Cavern or the Golden Grotto.

Each dragon provides an ability or benefit. This dragon provides a "once per round" ability (described above).

Egg storage capacity. Dragons can store 1 egg on each nest icon they have (e.g., this dragon has 1 nest icon).

Dragons have 1 of 4 traits: shy, aggressive, playful, or helpful.

## Wyr_Dragoncards_R8.Indd 109 Wyr_Dragoncards_R8.Indd 109

IMPORTANT: Whenever a dragon looks for a specific category (e.g., in this cave, a trait, a size, etc.), the dragon includes itself if applicable. For example, the Smirking Ridgeback (card 130) looks for playful dragons to tuck a card under; because the Smirking Ridgeback is a playful dragon, a card is tucked under it too.

Certain dragons and cave cards direct you to cache a resource onto a dragon, tuck a card under a dragon, lay an egg, or pay an egg:

CACHING A RESOURCE means that you place that resource onto a dragon. Unless otherwise specified, resources that you cache must come from your personal supply. Cached resources remain in place until the end of the game and are worth 1 VP each, unless otherwise specified.

- Resources must be cached onto the dragon that gives you the ability to do so, unless otherwise specified. A dragon that allows you to cache a resource "here" provides you with the ability to cache a resource onto that dragon. TUCKING A CARD means you place a face-down dragon card underneath an already played dragon on your player mat. Unless otherwise specified, cards that you tuck must come from your hand. Tucked cards remain in place until the end of the game and are worth 1 VP each, unless otherwise specified.

- Resources must be cached onto the dragon that gives you the ability to do so, unless otherwise specified. A dragon that allows you to cache a resource "here" provides you with the ability to cache a resource onto that dragon. TUCKING A CARD means you place a face-down dragon card underneath an already played dragon on your player mat. Unless otherwise specified, cards that you tuck must come from your hand. Tucked cards remain in place until the end of the game and are worth 1 VP each, unless otherwise specified.

- Resources must be cached onto the dragon that gives you the ability to do so, unless otherwise specified. A dragon that allows you to cache a resource "here" provides you with the ability to cache a resource onto that dragon. TUCKING A CARD means you place a face-down dragon card underneath an already played dragon on your player mat. Unless otherwise specified, cards that you tuck must come from your hand. Tucked cards remain in place until the end of the game and are worth 1 VP each, unless otherwise specified.

- Cards must be tucked under the dragon that gives you the ability to do so, unless otherwise specified by dragon abilities. A dragon that allows you to tuck a card "here" provides you with the ability to tuck a card underneath that dragon.

IMPORTANT: Tucked cards do not count as dragons for purposes of end game abilities or end-of-round goals that require you to have a specific number or type of dragons on your player mat. For instance, if you have a dragon that gives you VP for every medium dragon you have on your player mat, tucked medium dragons do not count.

LAY AN EGG OR PAY AN EGG:

An ability that lets you "lay an egg" allows you to place an egg onto any dragon with an empty nest icon or onto 1 of the 2 nest icons printed on your player mat. Each nest icon, regardless of its location, can hold 1 egg. If you do not have an empty nest icon available, then you may not lay an egg.

- Note that some dragons direct you to lay an egg "here." This allows you to lay an egg only on that dragon. Other dragons direct you to lay an egg anywhere in a certain cave or a certain column. 37

- Note that some dragons direct you to lay an egg "here." This allows you to lay an egg only on that dragon. Other dragons direct you to lay an egg anywhere in a certain cave or a certain column. 37

- Note that some dragons require you to pay an egg from a specific location (e.g. "Pay an egg from anywhere in this cave").

- Eggs on your dragons and player mat at the end of the game are worth 1 VP each, unless otherwise specified.

## Hatchlings

Hatchlings are a special type of dragon. All hatchlings require you to pay an egg, and all require you to pay 1, 2, or 3 milk. All Hatchlings have a 3-part ability:

## Miniature Rex

## 33 Hatchling

1

2

All hatchlings have an "if activated" ability. Each time your adventurer walks onto a hatchling, you may cache 1 resource (milk or meat) onto the hatchling or tuck 1 card under the hatchling, as specified on the card.

Any time you cache the specified resource on that hatchling or tuck a card under that hatchling, you gain a benefit. Note that you gain this benefit regardless of whether the cache or tuck ability came from walking your adventurer onto that card or from another ability.

The 3rd time you cache the specified resource on that hatchling or tuck a card under that hatchling, you gain their regular benefit and a bonus that is triggered once per game. This represents the hatchling growing up.

IMPORTANT: You may still continue to activate the hatchling's first 2 abilities (in the example above, caching a meat to gain a gold) even after the bonus is triggered.

IMPORTANT: Note that hatchlings function differently from other "if activated" dragons, as indicated by the card layout. Adult dragons with an "if activated" ability only allow you to activate that ability when your adventurer walks onto that dragon. In contrast, the second ability on each hatchling does not have an "if activated" ability on it, meaning that it activates any time that condition is met, regardless of whether it was triggered by your adventurer.

NOTE: As all good dracologists know, most hatchlings are born deep underground and require purple crystals to thrive. As such, keep in mind that most hatchlings live in the Amethyst Abyss. If you're looking for hatchlings that live in the Golden Grotto or Crimson Cavern, you may have a hard time finding one!

EXPLORE EXPLORE YOUR CRIMSON CAVERN: Walk your adventurer through your Crimson Cavern and activate any "if activated" abilities that your adventurer passes, following these steps in order:

1

Each time you walk through your Crimson Cavern, you must pay the costs printed on your player mat. The 1st time you enter your Crimson Cavern each round, the cost is 1 coin. If you enter a 2nd time that round, the cost is 1 coin and 1 egg. If you enter a 3rd time that round (this is the max, and it's rare), the cost is 1 coin and 2 eggs.

- If you walk through your Crimson Cavern a 2nd or 3rd time within a round, pay egg(s) from any dragon(s) or nests on your player mat.

- Whenever you enter a cave, leave the paid coin and egg(s) on your player mat (covering the associated cost to track how many times they have explored the cave this round). If the public supply of eggs or coins runs low, players may return excess items to the supply. 3

- Whenever you enter a cave, leave the paid coin and egg(s) on your player mat (covering the associated cost to track how many times they have explored the cave this round). If the public supply of eggs or coins runs low, players may return excess items to the supply. 3

Move your adventurer from left to right within your Crimson Cavern, along the path depicted along the bottom of the cave, and activate all "if activated" ( ) abilities that your adventurer passes, in order from left to right.

- Each time you walk past an "if activated" icon on your player mat, you may activate that ability.

- Each time you move your adventurer onto a dragon that has an "if activated" icon, you may activate that ability.

Whenever your adventurer walks onto a dragon), your turn ends. Return your adventurer back to Base Camp.

ADDITIONAL RULES, NOTES, AND CONCEPTS ABILITY ACTIVATION SEQUENCING: Any time an ability allows all players to do something, the active player goes first, then all other players have the opportunity to follow in clockwise order. Note that dragons and cave cards are not refilled into the card display board until the end of the current turn, after all players have had the opportunity to activate the ability. This means that in some circumstances, if an "all players gain a card" ability is triggered, not all players will have the opportunity to gain a face- up card (though they may still draw from the deck).

GAINING CARDS: There are 3 different phrases associated with gaining cards, all of which have different meanings.

## Gain A Dragon Or A Cave Card: Unless Additional

restrictions are specified, you may gain a card from either the face-up display or from the top of the deck. Note that there may be times when you have a "gain" ability, but there are no face-up cards in the display. If this happens, you may still draw from the top of the deck.

GAIN A DRAGON OR A CAVE CARD FROM THE DISPLAY: If the "from the display" instruction is included, you must select a face-up card. If there is no card in the display, then you may not take this benefit.

## Draw A Dragon Or A Cave Card: To "Draw" Means You

may only take a card from the top of the relevant deck.

REVEAL A DRAGON CARD: Show the top card of the deck to all players. The ability will specify if you do something with the card; if not, return it to the top of the deck.

ON YOUR PLAYER MAT OR IN A CAVE: Abilities that refer to the number of dragons on your player mat or in a cave never count tucked cards. Hatchlings are dragons.

PAYING AN ITEM: Certain abilities direct you to pay an item to trigger an ability. This requires you to discard that item from your hand (cave card or dragon), from your supply (resources or coins), or from any nest icon (egg) on your player mat, unless explicitly specified otherwise.

RESOURCES: Resources are gold, crystal, meat, and milk. Resources do not include coins or eggs.

RESOURCE EXCHANGE: At any point during the game, you may exchange 2 resources (gold, crystal, meat, and milk) in any combination for 1 resource of another type.

ACQUIRING ITEMS: Whenever you acquire a dragon, a cave card, or a resource, by default that item goes into your hand or your personal supply. Some dragons allow you to acquire an item and also provide optional secondary abilities, such as caching a resource or tucking a card. If you decline to do so, that item remains in your hand or your supply.

For example, see the Beckoning Cricketcatcher to the right. At the end of each round, you gain 1 card (from the face-up display or from the deck). After looking at it, decide whether to keep it in your hand or to tuck it under any dragon. If you tuck this card under a hatchling with a "tuck" ability, gain the benefit provided by that hatchling.

ACTIVATING ABILITIES MULTIPLE TIMES: Some abilities allow you to perform an action or exchange up to a certain number of times. Resolve each exchange or action individually. (You may use your benefit from the first exchange to pay for the second exchange, if applicable.)

7/27/23 11:36 AM 7/27/23 11:36 AM

CAPACITY LIMITS: At the end of each of your turns, you may have a maximum of 9 resource tokens, 9 dragons and/or cave cards (combined), and 9 coins. Discard any excess items until you have 9 of each type. If you gain an item that causes you to go over your capacity limit during another player's turn, you do not need to discard down until the end of your next turn.

CARD REFILL: Do not refill dragons or cave cards into the card display board until the end of each player's turn.

## Dragon Guild

Throughout the game, players earn Dragon Guild advancements ( their adventurers through their caves or playing certain dragons or cave cards. Every time a player takes a Dragon Guild advancement, they move their guild token 1 space clockwise around the Dragon Guild track, then immediately gain the benefit printed on the space their token lands on. Each space may hold any number of guild tokens. If a player activates more than 1 advancement in a turn, they receive all benefits that they pass, in addition to those printed on the space that they land on.

) by walking

Every time a player reaches 1 of the 2 brown spaces on the Dragon Guild track (the bottom space or the top space), they must immediately place an unused player marker onto a square on the Dragon Guild tile and collect the corresponding benefits. Each square can hold 1 player marker. Note, however, that the bottom right space of each Dragon Guild tile—a long rectangle—can hold any number of player markers.

Note that each player may place a maximum of 4 player markers onto the Dragon Guild tile. Once a player has placed their 4th player marker onto the Dragon Guild tile, they may continue to advance around the Dragon Guild track, but they cannot place any further player markers there.

Pay a coin, then excavate up to 2 spaces for free with cave cards from your hand.

Pay a cave card, then play a dragon from your hand on top of any other dragon on your player mat for free.

Gain 1 VP for every printed resource cost on all dragons in any one of your caves.

## Rules

Discard 1 coin, then you may excavate up to 2 spaces (in the same cave or different caves) without paying coin or egg costs. If you only have 1 cave card in your hand or you only wish to excavate 1 space, you may choose to forfeit the 2nd excavation.

Discard a cave card from your hand, then play a dragon from your hand onto another dragon already in your cave, without paying any costs. You still need to play the dragon into one of its preferred caves.

The original dragon on the space becomes tucked, and any tucked cards, cached resources, or eggs associated with the original dragon transfer to the new dragon. The new dragon can only store a number of eggs up to its printed capacity, and any surplus eggs are discarded.

Choose 1 cave (Crimson Cavern, Golden Grotto, or Amethyst Abyss). Count the resource icons (gold, meat, crystal, and milk) printed in the cost section of all dragons in that cave (do not count tucked cards). Gain 1 VP for each icon.

## Turn End Your Turn Ends After You Have Completed  Action (Excavate, Entice, Or Explore). Then:

- You must discard down to 9 coins, 9 cards, and 9 resource tokens.

- Play proceeds clockwise to the next player who has not yet passed this round.

ROUND END/UPKEEP After all players pass, the round ends. At the end of the round:

1. Players discard any coins and eggs that they paid as costs on their player mat.

2. All "once per round" dragon abilities activate.

i. Players activate "once per round" abilities in turn order, starting with that round's start player. If a player has multiple "once per round" dragons on their player mat, they may activate these dragons in any order.

ii. If a "once per round" dragon has an ability that presents all players with a choice or benefit, in clockwise order (starting with the owner of the dragon) each player makes their choice or gains their benefit.

3. The round's objective is scored.

i. Each player places 1 player marker on the round tracker underneath that round's

objective, corresponding to their position relative to other players. Players gain VP for these objectives at the end of the game.

a. If two or more players tie for 1st place, those players place their markers on the

"1st place" space. The next player then places their marker on the "2nd place" space.

b. If a player has no items specified by the objective (has a "zero" for that

objective), then they place their player marker on "all others" (0 VP), regardless of their position relative to other players.

NOTE: Each tile has the Automa solo mode icon those numbers in games with 2+ players.

## At The Beginning Of The Next Round:

1. The round marker moves 1 space to the right.

2. Refresh (

) the cards in the display. The 3 face-up dragons and the 3 face-up cave

cards in the display are discarded, and 3 new cards of each type are placed face up in the display.

3. Each player gains 6 coins and 1 egg.

i. Players add these coins to any coin(s) they carried over from the previous round.

Players may add the egg to any nest icon on their dragons or player mat if possible; if not, they may not gain the egg.

4. The start player marker advances 1 player clockwise.

## Game End And Scoring At The End Of The Game, Add Up Your Victory Points From The Following Categories:

- MARKERS ON THE DRAGON GUILD

- PRINTED VP VALUES on visible dragons on your player mat (not in hand and not tucked)

- END GAME ABILITIES ( not tucked)

## ) On Visible Dragons On Your Player Mat (Not In Hand And

- EGGS: Gain 11 per egg, unless otherwise specified. • CACHED RESOURCES: Gain 11 per cached resource, unless otherwise specified. • TUCKED CARDS: Gain 11 per tucked dragon, unless otherwise specified.

- PUBLIC OBJECTIVES: Ties are friendly. All players whose markers are at a certain level gain the VP printed on that space. For instance, if several players are tied for 1st place for scoring objective 3, those players would gain 66 . The next highest player for that objective would score 33 (for being in 2nd place).

- EXCESS ITEMS AND COINS:

- Gain 11 per coin you have remaining. • Gain 11 for every 4 other items (in any combination: resources, dragon cards, and cave cards) that you have remaining. Round down.

The player with the most VP wins! If tied, the player with the most visible dragons on their player mat (not including tucked cards) wins. If still tied, the victory is shared.

Special thanks to Elizabeth Hargrave, who was very open to the idea of a dragon- themed Wingspan featuring a number of new mechanisms designed by Connie Vogelmann. Elizabeth was involved as Wyrmspan's developer--someone who helps a game reach its full potential in terms of fun, functional, balanced, and intuitive--during the long design process, during which Connie spent countless hours playtesting, iterating, and creating the vast variety of cards found in this game. We at Stonemaier Games are grateful to work with such amazing, talented people like Elizabeth and Connie in extending the core foundation of Wingspan to dragons…and beyond.
